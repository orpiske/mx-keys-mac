Logitech MX Keys US Intl Alternative Layout for MacOS
===

This is an alternative keyboard layout for Logitech MX Keys US International keyboards.

If you are using this device in multiple operating systems you will notice that on MacOS it behaves differently than on Linux and Windows.

For instance, the following keys/chars are inverted:

| Linux/Windows | MacOS        |
|---------------|--------------|
| \\           | \`          |
| \|           | \˜          |
| \`           | §          |
| \~           | ±          |

This custom keyboard layout fix this annoying behavior.
